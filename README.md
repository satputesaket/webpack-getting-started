# Webpack getting started

This project has a collection of code snippets which might be useful to anybody who wishes to learn basics of webpack configuration. I have gone through some of the available code in the official webpack guide (https://webpack.js.org/guides/) and added a few modifications of my own.

## Getting Started

Please go through the the official webpack guide (https://webpack.js.org/guides/) for installing and setting up your environment.
